# Version Design

* Software:
  * Functionalty:
    * Receive data from sensor/dummy.
    * Process data.
    * Send data with a TCP-client.
  * Design:
    * All code is gathered in one file. This is probably a design which is more compatible for implementation in a Raspberry Pi Microcomputer.
  * Technologies:
    * Bluetooth/Wireless connection to the sensor.
    * Mathematical/Statistical functions for data processing.
    * TCP and Socket-technology for sending data.
